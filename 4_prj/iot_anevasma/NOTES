The DHT11 sensor that i acquired from the laboratory
didn't worked in the case(couldn't read any values)
so in the implementation there are mock values that are 
modified in order to be able to inspect them in the webpage
on the gauges.

The LED worked fine, and it was fully controllable by utilization 
of the webpage's slider.
